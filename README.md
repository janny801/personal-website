# 🌐 Personal Website  

A responsive portfolio website built using **React.js** to showcase my projects, experience, and skills. I wanted to build a small project that not only highlights my abilities through the website itself but also serves as a platform to showcase the other projects I've been working on. It also provides a way for people to reach out to me and learn a little more about who I am. This website features modern web design, animations, and interactive elements to enhance user engagement and provide a structured portfolio.

npm install      # Install all dependencies
npm start        # Runs the app in development mode at http://localhost:3000/
